Queries:
- Why aren't environment variables extracted from the docker-compose file?
- How do the docker-compose, k8s.yml and okteto.yml files relate? I guess I'll understand better the more I learn about kubernetes. I understood that the okteto.yml defines the sync between the kubernetes cluster at okteto cloud and the local filesystem.

Personal:
- Since the project is small I did not use git submodules because it seemed overkill. 

Details:
- The okteto manifest wasn't included in the repository.
