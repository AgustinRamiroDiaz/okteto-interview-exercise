Queries:
- The application is deployed with a public url. Ask about privacy and security.
- Why aren't environment variables extracted from the docker-compose file?

Personal:
- Since the project is small I did not use git submodules because it seemed overkill. 

Details:
- The okteto manifest wasn't included in the repository.
